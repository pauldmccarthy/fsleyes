This document contains the ``fsleyes`` release history in reverse
chronological order.



1.8.3 (Thursday 31st August 2023)
---------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New ``--cmapCycle`` command-line option, which automatically assigns a
  different colour map to each ``volume`` overlay (!402).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with overlays being interleaved when overlapping slices in
  the lightbox view (!403).
* Fixed some bugs in edit mode - crashes could occur when drawing/selecting
  voxels in highly anisotropic images, and the cursor size could vary for
  images with floating point imprecision in their pixdims (!404).


1.8.2 (Tuesday 22nd August 2023)
--------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with loading built-in plugins - the atlas panel (amongst
  others) was not being loaded (!400).


1.8.1 (Thursday 17th August 2023)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Filtered some irrelevant warning messages from underlying libraries (!395).


1.8.0 (Wednesday 16th August 2023)
----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New features in the lightbox view, allowing slices to be overlapping, and
  the order in which slices are displayed to be reversed. These features are
  available on the command-line via the ``--sliceOverlap`` and
  ``--reverseSlices`` flags (!379).
* FSLeyes plugin libraries can now provide custom layouts (!386).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The _Nudge_ panel now applies scaling parameters such that the
  centre-of-volume or the current cursor location are preserved. The previous
  behaviour was such that location (0, 0, 0) was preserved by the scaling
  parameters (!378).
* The FEAT cluster panel now remembers which contrast for a FEAT analysis was
  selected when switching between different analyses (!380).
* Updated the FSLeyes plugin architecture to use ``importlib`` instead of the
  deprecated ``pkg_resources``. FSLeyes plugin libraries no longer need to have
  a name beginning with ``fsleyes-plugin`` (!385).
* FSLeyes plugins provided by third-party libraries are now hidden by default,
  but are shown when a custom layout defined in the library is applied.  All
  plugins can be shown via the ``--showAllPlugins`` command-line option (which
  can be saved as a :ref:`default argument <command_line_default_arguments>`
  to be permanently applied) (!386).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Updates to the Jupyter Notebook integration to work with Notebook 7.x (!383).
* Fixed a transparency issue in the ortho panel (!384).


1.7.0 (Tuesday 13th June 2023)
------------------------------


Added
^^^^^

* New *colour range* option (available via the ``--colourRange`` command-line
  option) which can be used on vector overlays when colouring them by a
  secondary image, to specify the mapping between the voxel intensities and
  the colour map (!371).
* New *Show slice location* option, allowing the location of each slice to be
  displayed in the lightbox view (!375).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Changed the ``--initialDisplayRange`` command-line option to have the same
  behaviour as the ``--displayRange`` option - by default, the values will
  now be interpreted as raw intensities. Values can be specified as percentiles
  by appending a ``%`` to the high value (!366).
* Colour map and lookup table files may now have a ``.txt`` suffix instead of
  ``.cmap`` / ``.lut`` (!368).
* Colour map interpolation will now be applied to the colour bar shown in the
  ortho/lightbox/3D views (!368).
* Changed the behaviour of the *Clip by* and *Modulate by* settings for volume
  overlays - when clipping/modulating by a secondary image, and a negative
  colour map is in use, the *absolute* values of the secondary image are now
  used for clipping/modulation (!370).
* Changes to the mechanism used to save screenshots/movies, which should make
  the process more robust (!371).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed some issues with parsing command line arguments for RGB vector and
  complex images (!363, !364).
* Fixed an issue with plotting the MELODIC power spectrum for data with an
  odd number of timepoints (!365).
* Fixed an issue when passing a colour map file path to the ``--negativeCmap``
  option (!368).
* Fixed an issue related to loading NIfTI ``qform`` matrices which arose
  with ``nibabel >= 5.1.0`` (!369).
* Fixed an edit mode issue where a drawn line would have gaps in it (!369).
* Some minor fixes which allow the overlay type of a NIfTI image to be changed
  whilst it is being edited (!369).
* Fixed a small issue with ``volume`` overlays sometimes not being refreshed
  (!372).


1.6.1 (Thursday 23rd February 2023)
-----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Internal changes to avoid having to overwrite built-in ``matplotlib``
  colour maps (!360).


1.6.0 (Tuesday 20th February 2023)
----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* Added an *outline* button to the overlay display toolbar for mask overlays
  (!342).
* New ``--no3DInterp`` / ``-ni`` option, which prevents interpolation from
  being enabled for volume overlays when a 3D view is opened (!344).
* FSLeyes will now read "default" command-line arguments from a file called
  ``default_arguments.txt``, stored in the FSLeyes settings directory (!347).
* New ``--numSlices`` command-line option for use with lightbox views, which
  is an inverted alias for the ``--sliceSpacing`` option (!350).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* DICOM directories are now only scanned once, instead of each time they are
  opened via the *Add from DICOM* menu option (!345).
* The ``--useNegativeCmap`` / ``-un`` option is now automatically enabled when
  ``--negativeCmap`` / ``-nc`` is specified (!350).



Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed some issues related to shutting down FSLeyes cleanly, which could
  occasionally result in segmentation faults (!340).
* Fixed an issue with tractogram overlays not being drawn in some
  circumstances (!341).

* Fixed an issue with loading annotations when using ``fsleyes render`` (!346).


1.5.0 (Wednesday 31st August 2022)
----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* ``ViewPanel`` plugin classes can now implement the
  :meth:`~.ViewPanel.defaultLocation` static method to specify an initial
  location and size within the FSLeyes frame (!334).
* New built-in ``defaultlb`` and ``default3d`` layouts, which respectively open
  a lightbox or 3D view with standard toolbars and control panels.
* New ``--noBrowser`` / ``-nbb`` command-line option, which starts a Jupyter
  kernel without opening the Notebooks home page; this can be used when you
  wish to attach a terminal IPython instance to FSLeyes, instead of a Jupyter
  notebook (!334).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Redesigned the lightbox view to simplify behaviour and interaction (!334).
* Restored low-performance settings for the ortho and lightbox views (!333).
* The time series, power spectra and histogram panels now default to
  displaying data series from all compatible overlays, instead of just the
  currently selected overlay (!334).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed several issues related to mesh rendering in the lightbox view (!333).
* Fixed an issue with the location cursor (and other annotations) not being
  displayed when running FSLeyes in OpenGL 1.4 compatibility mode on macOS (!334).
* Fixed a memory leak triggered by the file tree panel (!334).


Removed
^^^^^^^


* Removed the ``--highDpi`` command-line and interface option - as of wxPython
  4.1.0, high DPI scaling should be taken care of automatically (!338).


1.4.6 (Tuesday 14th June 2022)

  versions of wxPython (!324).


1.4.2 (Friday 13th May 2022)
----------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Make sure atlas images (selected through the atlas panel) are loaded into
  RAM. This used to be the case, but default behaviour was changed recently in
  the ``fsl.data.image`` and ``fsl.data.atlases`` modules (!322).



1.4.1 (Tuesday 3rd May 2022)
----------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with 2D tractogram display on macOS (!318).


1.4.0 (Monday 2nd May 2022)
---------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* FSLeyes is now able to visualise TrackVis ``.trk`` and Mrtrix3 ``.tck``
  tractogram files, containing tractography streamlines (!307, !312).
* New *Invert modulata alpha* display setting (available via the
  ``--inverModulateAlpha`` command-line option), which can be used to
  make regions with high intensity more transparent (!311).
* New ``--index`` command-line option for ``volume`` overlays, allowing
  the indices for all non-spatial dimensions to be specified (!304).
* New option to display the coordinates for the current location on the
  canvases of an ortho view (available on the command-line via
  ``--showLocation``) (!314).

  the 3D view (!309).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with loading FIRST subcortical segmentation VTK meshes (!306).
* Fixed an issue with the ``--updatecheck`` commmand line argument (!306).
* Fixed some bugs in the *File tree panel* (!315).


Removed
^^^^^^^


* The ``--occlusion`` command-line option has been rendered obsolete by the
  improved 3D overlay blending, and so has been removed (along with the
  corresponding option in the 3D view settings panel).


1.3.3 (Thursday 23rd December 2021)
-----------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with black screenshot images in some environments (e.g.
  SSH sessions in mobaxterm) (!301).

1.3.0 (Monday 18th October 2021)
--------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* The 3D view now allows the display location to be set to the corresponding
  location under the mouse on a volume overlay, by shift+clicking (!290).
* The display range for a ``volume`` overlay can now be adjusted interactively
  by |command_key| + |shift_key| + right clicking (|control_key| + |shift_key|
  on Linux) and dragging to select a region - the display range will be set to
  the minimum/maximum voxel intensities within that region (!293).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The *Sample along line* tool now supports 2D and multi-channel (e.g. RGB)
  images (currently plotting the mean intensity across channels for the
  latter).
* Small improvementsto the *File* |right_arrow| *Add from XNAT* dialog (!291).


Fixed

  with the ``--autoDisplay`` / ``-ad`` option.(!293).


1.2.0 (Monday 13th September 2021)
----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* The **Display space** setting can now be set to *Scaled voxel coordinates*
  on ortho and lightbox views. This causes all images to be displayed in
  scaled voxels, with the origin for each image set to the centre of voxel
  ``(0, 0, 0)`` (!286).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The *scale vectors to unit length* option for line vector overlays now

  (!285).


1.1.0 (Friday 6th August 2021)
------------------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^


* The Location panel now displays the region label associated with the current
  vertex for mesh overlays which are being coloured with a lookup table (!278).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug which was preventing the same colour map or lookup table file to
  be specified more than once on the command line (!278).
* Fixed the *Check for updates* menu item - it now queries ``conda-forge`` for
  the latest available FSLeyes version (!279).
* Fixed a bug which had broken volume navigation in the time series view
  (!283).


Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^


* The ``--flatShading`` option for ``mesh`` overlays is equivalent to using
  ``--interpolation nearest`` (!278).


1.0.15 (Thursday 22nd July 2021)

  map logarithmically, rather than linearly (!254).


1.0.6 (Monday 24th May 2021)
----------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Overlay display options which refer to other overlays (e.g. *Clip by*) now
  use the display name of the other overlay, rather than their file base name

  (OpenGL 2.1 or newer only) (!222).
* New ``--lightDistance`` option (for 3D view), allowing the distance of the
  light source from the centre of the display bounding box to be set (!222).
* New ``--noBlendByIntensity`` option, for ``volume`` overlays in the 3D view,
  allowing the modulation of samples by voxel intensity to be disabled (!222).
* New ``-ixh``, ``-ixv``, ``-iyh``, ``-iyv``, ``-izh``, and ``-izv`` options,
  allowing ortho canvases to be inverted vertically or horizontally (!225).

  the canvases of an ortho view. Annotations can be saved to/loaded from file,
  via new options in the *Tools* menu (!233).
* New *Sample along line* tool, allowing data from an image to be sampled
  along a line and plotted (!235).


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Text labels drawn on GL canvases are now created using ``matplotilb`` rather
  than [Free]GLUT (!221).
* Removed dependence on [Free]GLUT - this means that ``fsleyes render`` can
  now be used on headless systems without using ``xvfb-run``, as long as
  `OSMesa <https://docs.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html>`_ is installed (!221).
* The ``--lightPos`` command-line option (for the 3D view) has been changed to
  expect three rotation values (in degrees), which specify the position of the
  light source with respect to the centre of the display bounding box. This
  can be combined with the new ``--lightDistance`` option to specify the
  position of the light source (!222).
* FSLeyes no longer ignores the ``LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT`` environment
  variable (!222).
* FSLeyes attempts to determine a suitable value for ``PYOPENGL_PLATFORM``
  if it is not already set (!222).
* FSLeyes should now work with both Wayland/EGL and X11/GLX builds of wxPython
  on Linux (!222).
* The normalisation method used in the power spectrum panel has been adjusted
  so that, instead of the data being normalised to unit variance before the
  fourier transform, the fourier-transformed data itself is normalised to the
  range [-1, 1] (!224).
* The *Show command line for scene* option will display a warning if any
  overlays are not saved (!226).
* The :class:`.FileTreePanel` has been updated to work with the
  new `file-tree <https://pypi.org/project/file-tree/>`_ library (!230).
* Change to the interface for copying/pasting data between images - there is
  now a single button for copying, pasting, and clearing the clipboard (!232).
* :class:`.annotations.TextAnnotation` objects can now be positioned in the
  display coordinate system, in addition to being positioned at pixel locations
  on a canvas (!232).
* Changes to the FSLeyes plugin system to ease the development of FSLeyes
  controls that use custom interaction profiles, and to improve switching
  between different interaction proflies (!234).
* The FSLeyes plugin system now supports tools which are bound to a specific
  view panel (!234).
* Many built-in FSLeyes control panels and tools have been migrated into the
  FSLeyes plugin system so that they are dynamically loaded as plugins, rather
  than being hard-coded (!234).
* It is now possible to save and re-load view/control panel layouts with
  plugin-provided views and control panels (!234).


Fixed
^^^^^


* Various fixes and improvements to the lighting effect on ``mesh`` overlays
  in the 3D view (!222).
* When opening a ``melodic_IC.nii.gz`` file with the
  ``--autoDisplay'`/``-ad``, option, the ``melodic_IC`` file is now selected
  by default, instead of the ``mean`` underlay (!219).
* Fixed a bug in image texture preparation for complex data types, when
  running in a limited GL environment (e.g. VNC) (!220).
* Compatibility fixes for newer versions of Jupyter `notebook` (!227).
* Fixed a problem with macOS desktop integration - it should now be possible
  to open a file with FSLeyes as the default application, and to drag a file
  onto the FSLeyes.app icon (!228).
* Improved stability when running under macOS+XQuartz (!229).
* Fixed an issue with screenshots generated by ``fsleyes render`` containing
  transparent pixels (!233).

-------------------------------


Added
^^^^^

* Various changes to improve GTK3 compatibility.
* Various changes to reduce warnings and unnecessary output messages.


Fixed
^^^^^

  behaviour before version 0.30.0, but was accidentally disabled for that
  release.


0.31.1 (Tuesday October 8th 2019)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug in edit mode where the image texture would not get updated
  correctly in restricted environments (e.g. VNC) with certain image data
  types.


0.31.0 (Thursday September 10th 2019)
-------------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New *File tree* control panel, for viewing data contained in structured
  directories.
* New ``complex`` overlay type, for displaying images with a complex data type.
* Support in plot panels for complex images - data from the real, imaginary,
  magnitude, and/or phase components can be plotted.
* New plot panel options to invert axes, and to apply scale/offsets.
* New power spectrum panel options to apply phase correction to complex image
  data.
* The atlas panel has basic support for more general "Statistic" atlas types.

  new empty image.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Images with a complex data type are no longer split into separate real and
  imaginary ``volume`` overlays - they are loaded as a single image, and
  displayed as ``complex`` overlays.
* The *Overlay* |right_arrow| *Copy* menu option now supports complex and
  RGB(A) images.
* The plugin interface for tools has changed slightly - tools provided by
  FSLeyes plugins are now passed references to the :class:`.OverlayList`, the
  :class:`.DisplayContext`, and to the main :class:`.FSLeyesFrame`, to their
  ``__init__`` method.


Fixed
^^^^^

  bitmap file is loaded it is internally converted into a 2D NIfTI image.
* New alternative main function :func:`fsleyes.filtermain.main`, which filters
  out useless warnings that originate from underlying libraries (e.g. ``wx``,
  GTK, Cocoa, etc).
* New ``--cliserver`` option, allowing command-line arguments to be passed
  to a single FSLeyes instance.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The :mod:`fsleyes.gl.textures` package has been cleaned up and refactored
  without any attempt to preserve backwards compatibility. Much of the texture
  data handling code is now shared by the :class:`.Texture2D` and
  :class:`.Texture3D` classes.
* The :class:`.NiftiOpts` class has been moved into a separate module.
* 2D NIfTI images are now displayed with a 2D texture - this means that

  control panels (including plugins) to customise the default panel
  positioning/layout.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* FSLeyes no longer depends on the ``deprecation`` library.


Fixed
^^^^^


* Jupyter Notebook integration has been updated to work with newer versions

  has no attribute '__version__'`` issue.


0.21.0 (Tuesday January 30th 2018)
----------------------------------


* FSLeyes is now able to load Freesurfer surface files, and ``mgh`` / ``mgz``
  images.
* The vertices of a 3D mesh (VTK, GIFTI, or Freesurfer file) can now be
  selected in both 3D and ortho views by holding down the shift key. If data
  is associated with the mesh vertices, it will be shown in the location
  panel, the time series panel, and the power spectrum panel. This feature is
  dependent on the presence of the `Trimesh
  <https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/>`_ library, a new optional dependency.
* Mesh vertex data is now shown on the histogram panel.
* It is now possible to associate multiple vertex files with mesh overlays.
  For Freesurfer/GIFTI surfaces, if other vertex files are found (e.g. pial,
  white matter, inflated), they will be added as options.
* Docked FSLeyes control panels can now be minimised by dragging the dock
  separator.
* The 3D view now has a toolbar, and standard panels when it is opened.

  line
* Colour maps and lookup table files can now be specified on the command line.
* The ``--vertexData`` command line argument, for mesh overlays, can be
  specified multiple times. All vertex data files will be pre-loaded, and the
  first one will be selected.
* New options on mask overlays to display the mask outline, and to apply
  interpolation on the display.
* The threshold range for mask overlays is now **exclusive** - now, only
  values which are within the threshold limits are displayed.  Previously,
  values which were within or equal to the limits were displayed.
* :class:`.Profile` instances can now notify arbitrary listeners of mouse and
  keyboard events, instead of only notifying via sub-class methods.


0.19.1 (Wednesday January 3rd 2018)

  DICOM to NIFTI conversion is performed using Chris Rorden's
  `dcm2niix <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/>`_ tool.
* The selected overlay can now be different in different FSLeyes views.
* Volume/timepoint properties can now be linked across views independently of
  other display properties. This is accessible via a new setting *Link overlay
  volume settings* in the view settings panel.
* All new overlays are now linked by default. This is so that the volumes
  for 4D images will be synchronised by default.
* Ortho edit mode has a new *Invert selection* option.
* Bug fix in time series and histogram panels regarding non-Image overlays
  (e.g. surfaces).
* Work around in screenshot logic for a bug in matplotlib (see
  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10084).


0.18.2 (Thursday December 7th 2017)

  value of 1000, and will also accept larger values.
* The :class:`.SliceCanvas` no longer resets the pan/zoom settings
  when an overlay is added/removed.
* The `xnat <https://bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy>`_ and
  `wxnatpy <https://github.com/pauldmccarthy/wxnatpy>`_ dependencies
  are now optional - the *Load overlay from XNAT* option will be disabled
  if these dependenceies are not present.
* New option to generate animated GIFs (see the :class:`.MovieGifAction`).

  enabled via the new ``--updatecheck`` option.
* Added the ability to load images from an XNAT server.
* Application font size can now be set via the ``--fontSize`` command line
  option.
* 3D volume clipping planes can now be applied as the intersection (default),
  union or complement of all active clipping planes.
* Bugfix in CLI generation - ``--overrideDataRange`` option does not get
  generated if data range override is disabled.
* Display space warning popups/changes are no longer used - instead, a little
  warning message is shown alongside a button that allows the user to change the
  display space manually.

  now be aligned to a reference image by setting the ``transform``
  property to ``'reference'``. Volume to reference transformation
  is now handled by individual ``NiftiOpts`` instances, rather than
  centrally by the ``DisplayContext``.

  directory.
* Nudge panel now displays a warning if the display space is set
  such that transform changes would not be seen.
* Various bug fixes to command line generation - ``--orientFlip``,
  ``--fgColour``, ``--displaySpace``, and overlay order.
* Fix to pyinstaller/CentOS7 build.
* Fix to image display on some VM environments - images were displayed
  at low contrast due to use of luminance texture.
