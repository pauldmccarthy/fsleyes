FSLeyes lookup tables
---------------------

All files in this directory, and its sub-directories, ending with '.lut' will
be loaded by FSLeyes, interpreted as a lookup table, and added as an option
for 'label' image overlays.

 Each line in a ``.lut`` file must specify the label value, RGB colour, and
associated label name.  The first column (where columns are space-separated)
defines the label value, the second to fourth columns specify the RGB values,
and all remaining columns give the label name.

You may add your own .lut files to this directory. When FSLeyes is restarted,
they will be made available as options for all overlays which use lookup
tables.

Add an entry in the order.txt file if you want the lookup table to have a
specific name, and to appear in a specific location in the drop down list.
