FSLeyes colour maps
-------------------

All files in this directory, and its sub-directories, ending with '.cmap' will
be loaded by FSLeyes, interpreted as a list of RGB colours, and added as a
colour map option for rendering images.

Each .cmap file is assumed to contain a list of RGB colours, one per line,
with each colour specified by three space-separated floating point values in
the range 0.0 - 1.0.

Feel free to add your own .cmap files, and put them in this directory, making
sure that the file name does not contain any spaces. When FSLeyes is
restarted, they will be made available under the colour map setting in image
display options.

Add an entry in the order.txt file if you want the colour map to have a
specific name, and to appear in a specific location in the drop down list
