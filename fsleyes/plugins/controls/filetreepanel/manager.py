"""This module contains the :class:`FileTreeManager`, which is used by the
:class:`.FileTreePanel`. It also contains the :class:`OverlayManager`, which
is used by the ``FileTreeManager``.


Overview
--------


The :class:`.FileTreePanel` allows the user to navigate structured
directories, where the files and sub-directories are named according to a
`FileTree <https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/file-tree/>`_
specification. The ``FileTreePanel`` allows the user to select which file
types to display, and to restrict or re-order the files with file tree
variables.


By default, the :class:`.FileTreePanel` will display a list containing one row
for every combination of variable values; each row will contain all files for
(the selected file types) which correspond to that combination of variables.
The user may also choose to display ``<all>`` values of a specific variable on
a single row.


This module handles the mechanics of generating lists of variables and files
according to the user's settings.


In this module, and in the :mod:`~.filetreepanel.filetreepanel` module,
variables which take on a different value for each row are referred to as
*varying*, and variables for which all possible values are displaed on one row
are referred to as *fixed*.


Example
-------


For example, imagine that we have a data set with data for multiple subjects
(``sub``) and sessions (``ses``), described by this file tree::

    subj-{participant}
      [ses-{session}]
        T1w.nii.gz (T1w)
        {hemi}.gii (surface)

So for one subject and one session, we might have the following files::

    T1.nii.gz
    L.gii
    R.gii

So we have two files types (``T1`` and ``surface``), and three variables
(``sub``, ``ses``, and ``hemi``).  By default, all variables are *varying*, so
the ``FileTreePanel`` will display this data set like so (the ``x`` indicates
whether or not each file is present):


======= ======= ========= ======  ===========
``sub`` ``ses`` ``hemi``  ``T1``  ``surface``
------- ------- --------- ------  -----------
``1``   ``1``   ``L``     ``x``   ``x``
``1``   ``1``   ``R``     ``x``   ``x``
``1``   ``2``   ``L``     ``x``   ``x``
``1``   ``2``   ``R``     ``x``   ``x``
``2``   ``1``   ``L``     ``x``   ``x``
``2``   ``1``   ``R``     ``x``   ``x``
``2``   ``2``   ``L``     ``x``   ``x``
``2``   ``2``   ``R``     ``x``   ``x``
======= ======= ========= ======  ===========


However, it may make more sense to display all of the surface files together.
The user can do this by setting the ``hemi`` variable to ``<all>``, thus
changing it to a *fixed* variable. This will cause the :class:`.FileTreePanel`
to re-arrange the grid like so:


======= ======= ====== =================== ===================
``sub`` ``ses`` ``T1`` ``surface[hemi=L]`` ``surface[hemi=R]``
------- ------- ------ ------------------- -------------------
``1``   ``1``   ``x``  ``x``               ``x``
``1``   ``2``   ``x``  ``x``               ``x``
``2``   ``1``   ``x``  ``x``               ``x``
``2``   ``2``   ``x``  ``x``               ``x``
======= ======= ====== =================== ===================
