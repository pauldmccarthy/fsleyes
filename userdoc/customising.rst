 Customising FSLeyes
====================


This page contains details on customising various aspects of FSLeyes.


.. note:: If you are a Python developer, and want to develop custom plugins
          for FSLeyes, check out the page on :ref:`plugins <fsleyes_plugins>`.


.. _customising_fsleyes_settings_directory:

FSLeyes settings directory
==========================


FSLeyes stores all of its user-specific settings, and user-added colour maps,
lookup tables, and layouts in a directory which, under macOS, will be located
at::

  $HOME/.fsleyes/


Under Linux, the FSLeyes directory will be found in either::

  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fsleyes/

or::

  $HOME/.config/fsleyes/


Most FSLeyes settings are stored in a Python `pickle
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ file called ``config.pkl``.
The *FSLeyes* |right_arrow| *Clear FSLeyes settings* menu option simply
deletes this directory, which causes FSLeyes to forget all settings (and
user-added colour maps, lookup tables, and layouts).


.. _customising_fsleyes_site_directory:

FSLeyes site configuration directory
====================================


FSLeyes can load colour maps, lookup tables, and layouts from a site-specific
directory which can be specified via an environment variable called
``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}``. This may be useful if you are managing a
multi-user installation and would like to make a set of custom colour maps,
lookup tables, and/or layouts available to all users.

FSLeyes will automatically load colour maps, lookup tables and layouts that
are respectively located in these directories:

 - ``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/colourmaps/``
 - ``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/luts/``
 - ``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/layouts/``

The expected file formats are outlined in the sections below.


.. _customising_default_arguments:

Default command-line arguments
==============================

If there are some FSLeyes command-line options which you would always like
to have applied, you can store them in a file called
``default_arguments.txt``, located within the FSLeyes settings or site
configuration directory.  More information on this file can be found
:ref:`here <command_line_default_arguments>`.



.. _customising_colour_maps:

Colour maps
===========

For :ref:`volume <overlays_volume>` overlays, the :ref:`overlay display panel
<overlays_overlay_display_panel>` has a **Load colour map** button which
allows you to load new colour maps into FSLeyes.  Clicking on this button will
bring up a file selection dialog, allowing you to choose a file which contains
a custom colour map.


FSLeyes can read in two types of colour map files, both described below:

 - :ref:`RGB files <customising_rgb_colour_map_files>`, which simply contain a
   list of RGB values
 - :ref:`VEST files <customising_vest_colour_map_files>`, which are in the
   format used by `FSLView <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslView/>`_.


When you apply a colour map to an image, FSLeyes will map the image display
range to the colours in the colour map - the low display range value will map
to the first colour in the colour map (i.e. the first colour in the file), and
the high display range to the last colour (the last colour in the file). The
**Interpolate colour maps** setting for :ref:`volume <overlays_volume>` allows
you to define a continuous colour map by only specifying a few colours. For
example, you could define the greyscale colour map with just two colours::


  0.0 0.0 0.0
  1.0 1.0 1.0


When the **Interpolate colour maps** setting is enabled, FSLeyes will
interpolate between these colours.


Built-in colour maps
--------------------


FSLeyes comes with a set of built-in colour maps - these files (formatted as
:ref:`RGB files <customising_rgb_colour_map_files>`) can be found at::

  <env-dir>/lib/python<pyver>/site-packages/fsleyes/assets/colourmaps/

where ``<env-dir>`` is the location of the Python environment into which
FSLeyes is installed, and ``<pyver>`` is the Python version (e.g. `3.11`).

You can customise the display names and order of the built-in colour
maps. Inside the ``colourmaps/`` directory you will find a file called
``order.txt``. This file defines the order in which colour maps are displayed
in the FSLeyes interface, and also contains the display name for each colour
map; it contains a list of colour map file names (without the ``.cmap``
suffix), and corresponding display names for each::


  greyscale        Greyscale
  red-yellow       Red-Yellow
  blue-lightblue   Blue-Light blue
  red              Red
  ...


Any colour maps which exist in the ``colourmaps/`` directory, but are not
listed in ``order.txt`` will still be available in the FSLeyes interface, but
will be added after all of the colour maps listed in ``order.txt``.


.. warning:: When creating your own ``.cmap`` file, make sure that there are
             no spaces in the file name. This also applies to ``.lut`` files
             (covered :ref:`below <customising_lookup_tables>`).


User- and site-added colour maps
--------------------------------


When you load a custom colour map through the :ref:`overlay display panel
<overlays_overlay_display_panel>`, FSLeyes will ask you if you would like to
install it permanently. If you choose to do so, FSLeyes will save the colour
map (as a :ref:`RGB file <customising_rgb_colour_map_files>`) under the
:ref:`FSLeyes settings directory <customising_fsleyes_settings_directory>` (in
a sub-directory called ``colourmaps/``), renaming the file so it ends with
``.cmap``. In the FSLeyes interface, all user-added colour maps will appear
after the built-in colour maps.


You can also create your own ``order.txt`` file and store it alongside the
user-added colour map files - it will be used in place of the built-in
``order.txt`` file.

FSLeyes will also automatically load any colour maps stored in
``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/colourmaps/``.

.. _customising_rgb_colour_map_files:

RGB colour map files
--------------------


RGB colour map files simply contain a list of RGB colours, one per line, with
each colour specified by three space-separated floating point values in the
range ``0.0 - 1.0``, with each value corresponding to the R, G, and B colour
channels respectively. For example::


  1.000000 0.260217 0.000000
  0.000000 0.687239 1.000000
  0.738949 0.000000 1.000000


.. _customising_vest_colour_map_files:

VEST colour map files
---------------------


VEST colour map files follow the colour map file format supported by
FSLView. They contain a list of RGB colour tuples, with some additional
metadata [*]_. A VEST file looks something like this::


  %!VEST-LUT
  %%BeginInstance
  <<
  /SavedInstanceClassName /ClassLUT
  /PseudoColorMinimum 0.00
  /PseudoColorMaximum 1.00
  /PseudoColorMinControl /Low
  /PseudoColorMaxControl /High
  /PseudoColormap [
  <-color{0.000000,0.000000,0.000000}->
  <-color{0.010000,0.010000,0.010000}->
  .
  .
  .
  <-color{1.000000,1.000000,1.000000}->
  ]
  >>

  %%EndInstance
  %%EOF


.. [*] FSLeyes ignores all of the metadata contained in VEST colour map files,
       and only extracts the RGB colour values.


.. _customising_lookup_tables:

Lookup tables
=============


:ref:`Label <overlays_label>` overlays are coloured according to a lookup
table, which is distinct from a :ref:`colour map
<customising_colour_maps>`. The :ref:`lookup table panel
<overlays_the_lookup_table_panel>` allows you to create your own lookup
tables, and load a lookup table from a file.


FSLeyes manages lookup tables for label overlays in a very similar manner as
for colour maps. A FSLeyes lookup table file has a name that ends in ``.lut``,
and defines a lookup table which may be used to display images wherein each
voxel has a discrete integer label.  The lookup table file defines a name and
a colour for each of the possible voxel values in such an image.


Each line in a ``.lut`` file must specify a label value, RGB colour, and
associated name.  The first column (where columns are space-separated) defines
the label value, the second to fourth columns specify the RGB values, and all
remaining columns give the label name. For example::


        1  0.00000 0.93333 0.00000 Frontal Pole
        2  0.62745 0.32157 0.17647 Insular Cortex
        3  1.00000 0.85490 0.72549 Superior Frontal Gyrus


FSLeyes manages lookup table files in the same manner as described for
:ref:`colour maps <customising_colour_maps>`. Built-in lookup table files can
be located under the FSLeyes ``assets/luts/`` directory. A file called
``order.txt`` allows you to customise the display names and order of built-in
lookup tables.  Custom lookup tables which are added via the :ref:`lookup
table panel <overlays_the_lookup_table_panel>` are saved into the
:ref:`FSLeyes settings directory <customising_fsleyes_settings_directory>`, in
a sub-directory called ``luts``. FSLeyes will also automatically load any
lookup tables stored in ``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/luts/``.


.. _customising_layouts:

Layouts
=======


FSLeyes allows you to save your view and control panel configuration as a
_layout_. You can save and load your custom layouts from the *Views*
|right_arrow| *Layouts* menu. FSLeyes layouts are stored as plain-text files
in the :ref:`FSLeyes settings directory
<customising_fsleyes_settings_directory>`, in a sub-directory called
``layouts/``. FSLeyes will also read any layout files that are stored in

``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/layouts/``.

FSLeyes layout files are stored as plain-text, and must end with a suffix of
``.txt``.  These files have the format::

  <layout-title>
  <layout-specification>

where:
 - ``<layout-title>`` is the display title for the layout (i.e. how it will
   appear in the *Views* |right_arrow| *Layouts* menu); and
 - ``<layout-specification>`` is a FSLeyes layout specification, as described
   in the :mod:`fsleyes.layouts` module documentation.

If you need to manually create a FSLeyes layout file, the easiest option is to
follow these instructions:

1. Open FSLeyes, and set up your layout by hand (i.e. opening the views and
   controls that you wish to have included in your layout).

2. Start a Jupyter Notebook session via the *File* |right_arrow| *Open
   notebooks* menu option. Alternatively, you could start FSLeyes with the
   ``-nb`` or ``-nbb`` options - see the page on :ref:`FSLeyes and Jupyter
   notebook <fsleyes_notebook>` for more details.

3. Enter the following code into a notebook or attached Python terminal::

     from fsleyes import layouts
     with open('my_layout.txt', 'wt') as f:
         f.write('My layout title\n')
         f.write(layouts.serialiseLayout(frame))

The file ``my_layout.txt`` will contain the FSLeyes layout specification -
in order to use this file, you can copy it into the FSLeyes settings
directory (within the ``layouts/`` sub-directory) or
``${FSLEYES_SITE_CONFIG_DIR}/layouts/``.


.. _customising_atlases:

Atlases
=======


The :ref:`atlas management <atlases_atlas_management>` panel allows you to
load custom atlases into FSLeyes. FSL |fsl_version| and FSLeyes |version|
supports atlases which are described by an ``xml`` file that adheres to the
`FSL atlas XML file format
<https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases-Reference>`_.


FSLeyes |version| understands two types of atlases [*]_:


 - A *label* (or *summary*) atlas is a 3D NIFTI image which contains different
   discrete integer values for each region defined in the atlas.


 - A *probabilistic* atlas is a 4D NIFTI image, where each volume contains a
   probability map for one region in the atlas.  This probabilistic image may
   also be accompanied by a corresponding label image.


Multiple versions of these images, at different resolutions, may exist
(e.g. 1mm and 2mm versions of the same image may be present).


If you have an atlas image which you would like to use in FSLeyes, you must
write an ``xml`` file which describes the atlas, contains paths to the atlas
image(s), and contains a description of every region in the atlas.


The best way to create one of these files is to look at the atlas files that
exist in ``$FSLDIR/data/atlases``. Create a copy of one of these files -
select one which describes an atlas that is similar to your own atlas
(i.e. probabilistic or label) - and then modify the atlas name, file paths,
and label descriptions to suit your atlas.  Your ``xml`` atlas file should end
up looking something like the following:


.. code-block:: xml

   <atlas>

     <!-- The header defines the atlas name, type,
          and paths to the atlas image files. -->
     <header>

       <!-- Human-readable atlas name -->
       <name>Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas</name>

       <!-- Abbreviated atlas name -->
       <shortname>HOCPA</shortname>

       <!-- Atlas type - "Probabilistic" or "Label" -->
       <type>Probabilistic</type>

       <!-- Paths (defined relative to the location
            of this XML file) to the atlas images.
            Multiple <images> elements may be present
            - one for each resolution in which the
            atlas is available. -->
       <images>

         <!-- If the atlas type is "Probabilistic", the
              <imagefile> must be a path to a 4D image
              which contains one volume per region.
              Otherwise, if the atlas type is "Label",
              the <imagefile> must be a path to 3D
              label image. -->
         <imagefile>/HarvardOxford/HarvardOxford-cort-prob-2mm</imagefile>

         <!-- If the atlas type is "Probabilistic", the
              <summaryimagefile> must be a path to a 3D
              label image which 'summarises' the
              probabilistic image. If the atlas type is
              "Label", the <summaryimagefile> is identical
              to the <imagefile>. There must be a
              <summaryimagefile> for every <imagefile>. -->
         <summaryimagefile>/HarvardOxford/HarvardOxford-cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm</summaryimagefile>
       </images>

       <!-- A 1mm version of the same atlas images. -->
       <images>
         <imagefile>/HarvardOxford/HarvardOxford-cort-prob-1mm</imagefile>
         <summaryimagefile>/HarvardOxford/HarvardOxford-cort-maxprob-thr25-1mm</summaryimagefile>
       </images>
     </header>

     <!-- The <data> element contains descriptions
          of all regions in the atlas. -->
     <data>

       <!-- Every region in the atlas has a <label> element which defines:

            - The "index". For probabilistic atlases, this is the index
              of the corresponding volume in the 4D image file. For
              label images, the index is the value of voxels which
              are in the corresponding region. For 3D summary images of
              probabilistic atlases, add 1 to the index to get the
              label value.

            - The "x", "y", and "z" coordinates of a pre-
              calculated "centre-of-gravity" for this region.
              These are specified as voxel coordinates,
              relative to the *first* image in the <images>
              list, above.

            - The name of the region. -->

       <label index="0" x="48" y="94" z="35">Frontal Pole</label>
       <label index="1" x="25" y="70" z="32">Insular Cortex</label>
       <label index="2" x="33" y="73" z="63">Superior Frontal Gyrus</label>

       <!-- ... -->

       <label index="46" x="44" y="21" z="42">Supracalcarine Cortex</label>
       <label index="47" x="37" y="15" z="34">Occipital Pole</label>
     </data>
   </atlas>


.. [*] Future releases of FSL and FSLeyes will support different types of
       atlases (e.g. longitudinal, surface-based, etc.).
